# CRES
CRES Python Repo
This is the main git for CRES' python 


v1.py is the latest and greatest version of the CRES program. It should be able to:

 add locations to csv files specified by locfile, 

 Give directions according to the route_build menu. Still need to insert pickups.py to record the volume at each pickup. 


Still need to create csv system to track individual pickup statistics. 





This change came from the Linux side!
