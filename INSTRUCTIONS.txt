Ok so the first thing you're going to want to do is open
up Terminal, just open up spotlight and type "terminal" then hit enter.

You should see a shell window open, that's good! 

type 'cd ~/the/path/to/where/you/unzipped'

Type 'ls'

If you are in the right directory a list of all the unzipped files should pop up. If not type 'pwd' to see where you are and cd to change directory to the path you want. 

Once you're in the right dir, type 'python setup.py install'
and let it do its thing. 

Once it's done loading you can launch the program by typing 
	"./main_program.py"
into the Terminal. Just make sure you're in the correct directory (directory means file, you can check using pwd). 

	pwd returns present working directory
	cd /path/you/want/to/follow changes directory to whatever path you 		type

The first time you execute main_program.py ( ./ means execute) it's going to throw an error, something along the lines of "you don't have a directory called ~/GDrive/cres_sheets"

This is where you need to have the GoogleDrive (mine is called GDrive and yours needs to be called that too). The tilde (~) is short for /Users/AsianCheddar in my case, on your computer that's going to be /Users/MichaelMirabelli I believe. It's the folder that your music, docs and pictures folders default to in OSX. (This is called your HOME FOLDER, as opposed to the ROOT folder which has a path of just / )

Once you get the directories in the right place everything should work fine! 

Just a heads up though in general hitting close or typing q will quit the program (there's instructions on each page) but X-ing out the window will move the program on to the next stage. 

----->>> Just don't hit the x's at the top (or command-W) <<<-----
