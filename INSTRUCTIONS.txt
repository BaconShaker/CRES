Ok so the first thing you're going to want to do is open
up Terminal, just open up spotlight and type "terminal" then hit enter.

You should see a shell window open, that's good! 

type 'cd ~/the/path/to/where/you/unzipped'

Type 'ls'

If you are in the right directory a list of all the unzipped files should pop up. If not type 'pwd' to see where you are and cd to change directory to the path you want. 

Once you're in the right dir, type 'python setup.py install'
and let it do its thing.
